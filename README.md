A simple tool to analyse version 1 GUIDs/UUIDs from a system. With the information obtained from analysis, it is often possible to forge future v1 GUIDs created by the system, if you know the approximate time they were created.

# Installation
Clone the repository, `cd` into it and run:
```
pip install .
```
[pipx](https://github.com/pypa/pipx) can be used in place of pip.

Once installed, you should be able to run `guidtool -h` to see the help text.

# Usage
## Inspecting GUIDs
Version 1 GUIDs can be inspected with `guidtool -i <guid>`:
```
$ guidtool -i 95f6e264-bb00-11ec-8833-00155d01ef00
UUID version: 1
UUID time: 2022-04-13 08:06:13.202186
UUID timestamp: 138691299732021860
UUID node: 91754721024
UUID MAC address: 00:15:5d:01:ef:00
UUID clock sequence: 2099
```

## Creating GUIDs
If you have a sample GUID from a system, and know the approximate time a target GUID you wish to guess was created, you can generate a list of potential GUIDs to try guess by supplying the approximate GUID creation time to `-t`:
```
$ guidtool -t '2022-04-13 09:12:54' 95f6e264-bb00-11ec-8833-00155d01ef00 | head
e6079880-bb09-11ec-8833-00155d01ef00
e607bf90-bb09-11ec-8833-00155d01ef00
e607e6a0-bb09-11ec-8833-00155d01ef00
e6080db0-bb09-11ec-8833-00155d01ef00
e60834c0-bb09-11ec-8833-00155d01ef00
e6085bd0-bb09-11ec-8833-00155d01ef00
...
```

By default this assumes that:
- The time encoded in the GUID is only precise to the nearest millisecond (10,000 100-nanosecond intervals). You can change this by specifying the number of 100-nanonsecond intervals between each GUID generated by the target with `-p`. To determine the correct number here, obtain a few GUIDs from the system, check the number of 0s at the end of their timestamps with `guidtool -i`, and then use a 1 followed by that number of 0s as the argument to `-p`.
- The estimated GUID creation time is within 1 second of the real GUID creation time. You can create GUIDs for a wider range of times using `-r`, e.g. if you are only within 3 seconds then supplying `-r 3` will generate GUIDs starting 3 seconds before and ending 3 seconds after the time given in `-t`.
